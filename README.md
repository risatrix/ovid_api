#Ovid API
This is a Django app that houses Ovid's love poems as structured data. Theoretically, someone else could download this and used it to run their own Ovid app, but it's not there yet because I'm not committing the settings files.

##Uh, Why?
Because I want to have an Ovid API to use for a bot. Also, I don't think Vergil should be the only Latin author with a dedicated API.

#TODOs
Right now I'm working on nesting the API urls the way I want. I'll also break out the settings files when I deploy the app on Heroku.
