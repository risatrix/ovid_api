# Ovid API
The current version lives [here] (https://ovid-api.herokuapp.com/).

This is a Django app that houses Ovid's love poems as structured data. Theoretically, someone else could download this and used it to run their own Ovid app, but it's not there yet because I'm not committing all the settings files.

## Uh, Why?
Because I want to have an Ovid API to use for a bot. Also, I don't think Vergil should be the only Latin author with a dedicated API.

## TODOs
Obviously, there are a lot of things I should do, such as fixing the static files, fixtures, and adding tests. Or I could move on to trying to make an emoji dictionary for Ovid, or populating the API with more stuff. A Roman sense of piety may or may not win out here.
