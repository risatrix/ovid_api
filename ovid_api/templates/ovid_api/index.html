							<h2>About this Site</h2>

							<p>This site serves as a place to grab Ovid's poetry with code. Using it assumes some knowledge of API's, but I'll try to lay things out for
                people who haven't done that before. If you are familiar with APIs, you might want to look directly at the docs page.</p>

          <h2>Why Do I Care?</h2>
          <p>If you need material for a bot project, or a Javascript project, or whatever else, it's here.</h2>

          <h2>How do I use this thing?</h2>

          <p>To get a list of all works, try: <code>/authors/ovid/works/</code></p>

          <p>The author and work use an all lower case slug, and everything else is numbers. </p>
          <p>To get a poem, you need to use a book number and poem number, <em>even if that's not how you'd traditionally cite the poem.</em></p>

          <p>So, the same way you'd use: <code>/authors/ovid/works/amores/books/1/</code></p>

          <p>You need to add a book number: <code>/authors/ovid/works/heroides/books/1/</code></p>

          <p>To get a particular line: <code>/authors/ovid/works/ars/books/2/lines/34/</code>

          If you already know what you want you can use the short version, remembering to include the book and poem number:
          <code>/ovid/medicamina/1/1/34</code>
          </p>


          <hr>
          <h2>Technical details</h2>
          To get the results in JSON for your code, you need to add <code>=json</code> to the end of the url.

          <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
          The material for this site was originally XML created by the Perseus project.
          The styling for this page comes from the <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/">Ed Jekyll theme</a>.
          This API site is Django, and uses the REST API and Swagger documentation.
